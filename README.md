# Message-Encrypter
This Message Encryptor is written in Python 3.8.5. I made this for people to be able to talk in privacy. Share this with someone you want to talk to in privacy. If you want to change the key so it really ONLY is YOU and YOUR FRIEND who will be able to decrypt the messages, edit the source code.
